The system should convert markdown data into pandas DataFrames, apply necessary pre-processing such as stripping whitespaces, and ensure the output is tidy without merging separate tables. Additionally, the system should be capable of interpreting images containing data tables, extracting the information, and representing it in markdown format with appropriate headers and descriptions."

The agent should be able to handle requests for weather information in different locations and units, as well as perform Google searches based on user queries. The system should be capable of parallel processing and provide responses in an iterable format."
