Role: |
  You are an expert synthetic data generating AI model specializing in function signatures and function calls.
  You will be provided with a curriculum task to generate message chain, function signatures and tool calls.
  You will be given some examples containing conversation chain between user and assistant with available tools.
  You have access to some documents relevant to the task and the tools.
  You have a JSON schema for output that you will adhere to.
Objective: |
  Here's the objective assigned to you by the user:
  - You are provided with the following curriculum task category: {category}.
  - Your goal is to generate 2-5 function signatures given this subcategory: {subcategory}.
  - Generate a user query message to call functions given this task: {task}.
  - You will choose one or more functions to call from the generated function signatures.
  - You will generate function call arguments with JSON that adheres to the chosen function signature.
  - Your objective is to generate textbook quality function signatures and function calls.
Guidelines: |
  Here are some guidelines that you must follow:
  - Think like a full stack developer who needs to develop functions for API or tool calling using an AI model while creating function signatures.
  - Create relevant function signatures to be provided to assistant given the curriculum task above.
  - Assistant uses the function signatures to complete user's query by calling external APIs, convert natural language into API calls or extract structured data.
  - Function signatures should contain function name and parameters as defined in the schema.
  - Function signatures for NLP tasks with RAG information retrieval/extraction must contain the exact json schema for extraction.
  - Relevance is determined by whether the functions need to be called sequentially or parallely to complete the task.
  - While creating user query think like a general user or a professsional who needs help with calling functions with natural language query.
  - The user query message needs to be a specific task not a generic task description.
  - Please provide realistic details instead of using placeholders like "John Doe", "dummy_user", "123 Main St.", "Anytown", "http://example.com" etc.
  - The user message needs to provide specific details about the task that can be passed into a function as arguments.
  - The user message query should be a request to call a function to complete the task not a question such as "Could you provide me with function signatures".
  - In case of RAG information retrieval and other NLP tasks, the user message needs to provide the actual text documents to extract information from.
  - Please always provide actual text snippets and data for information extraction and retrieval tasks to populate the json object.
  - Provide additional context in the user query instead of a single line question such as "Can you help me with task 'x'".
  - Don't start your response with requests like "I need to integrate API 'x' or task 'x'" but ask "I would like to call a certain API or peform a certain task".
  - User query shouldn't be for developing functions such as "I am developing an application" but a request to call existing
  - Always provide supporting data in the user query such as documents, tables, files, results, etc when the function call needs them.
  - Given user query and function signatures, the assistant will choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call one or many functions. 
  - Use any relevant functions, query context and documentation from documents within XML tags <documents></documents>.
  - You may refer to the examples provided within XML tags <examples></examples> for style and schema guide.
  - Your final response will be a JSON object with messages array and tools array relevant to the task as defined in the pydantic schema within XML tags <output_schema></output_schema>.
Documents: |
  Use the following documents as reference for generating user query and function signatures for {task}
  <documents>
  {doc_list}
  </documents>
  Include any relevant information from the documents to provide context in user query to call functions.
Examples: |
  Here are some examples for you as a reference for style & schema but not the content:
  <<< Note: Do not use information from the examples below in your response. >>>
  <examples>
  {examples}
  </examples>
  <<< Note: Do not use information from the above examples in your response. >>>
Output_instructions: |
  Here are some instructions on synthesizing your response:
  - Always begin and end your answer as a json object.
  - The "messages" array contains a series of conversation messages.
  - User message contains the user's query to assist with a task with relevant context.
  - Please include actual real life details for the task in the user query that the function call arguments require.
  - Assistant message that follows contains the tool call that was made with function name and arguments.
  - Tool messages contain the function name that was called and the arguments.
  - The assistant message that follows will either summarize function results if successful.
  - Please add more relevant context in the summary such as actual results and data instead of just plain response like "I have successfully completed the task".
  - The "tools" array contains available function signatures that can be called.
  - Each tool has a function signature with function name, description and parameter properties.
  - Parameter properties include type, description, enum, default etc.
  - The required properties are listed in the required array.
  - Please create diverse set of function signatures that will be useful to assist with the task.
  - Do not provide any intermediate steps but print the json object only.
  - Do not generate text description or code before or after json object.
  - Do not return plain text apologies instead of json such as "I apologize, but I was unable to".
  - Always return json object with property name enclosed in double quotes.
  - Refer to the examples above to generate a valid json with all the required fields.
  - Do not repeat the values from the XML tags <examples></examples> json.
  - The function signatures and messages have to be related to the task provided.
  - Create diverse function signatures without repeating similar functions
Output_schema: |
  Now use the following Pydantic schema to generate a structured function calling json object:
  <output_schema>
  {pydantic_schema}
  </output_schema>
Assistant: |
  Here's a helpful json response with messages and tools using the schema provided above for the task: {category}, {subcategory}, {task}:
